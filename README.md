# 🎥 Preetify
Preetify is my first video-sharing application built using React Native and Expo-AV, with Appwrite as the backend database. It’s a cross-platform mobile application designed to let users share their own videos along with thumbnails and descriptions, while also discovering content from others.

# ✨ Features
📸 Video Upload — Users can upload videos with a thumbnail and description.

🎞️ Reels & Full Video View — Watch uploaded videos either as quick reels or full video playback.

🔒 User Authentication — Secure signup and login screens to manage user access.

❤️ Like Videos — Users can like videos uploaded by other creators.

🎨 NativeWind for Styling — Clean, efficient, utility-first CSS-in-JS styling using NativeWind.

📱 Cross-Platform — Compatible with both Android and iOS devices.
